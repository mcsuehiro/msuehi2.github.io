          <p>Rent Application is a tool for landlords to create, send digital rental applications, and order screening reports on potential tenants. As lead designer, I redesigned the entire platform to improve the user’s experience.</p>

          <h2>The Brief</h2>
          <p>Rent Application was experiencing high a drop off rate from new users. I was brought on to help identify causes of the issue and design solutions to address the problems. 
          <br><br>
          As lead designer on this project, I was involved in all phases of the project from research and design to production. My tasks included conducting user research, wireframing, designing the high fidelity screens as well as crafting marketing material. I worked directly with the development team to produce an improved onboarding experience for new users.</p>

            <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
            <p>To address these key issues among many others, we decided the platform needed a comprehensive redesign. I created wireframes and prototypes to quickly gather user feedback and iterate on the solutions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Designing a new onboarding experience</h3>

      <h3>Ditching the complex pricing model</h3>
      <p>In order to communicate pricing to users, I guided users through a flow where users create their first form, which allowed users to select the reports they wanted with the associated costs displayed, and show the price total at the bottom change depending on which reports users selected.
      <br><br>
      I also changed the label wording  from generic “Price” to “Fee paid by applicant” to inform the user that applicants will pay the fees.</p>

          <p>Experian verification is only required if users want to run credit reports. The purpose was unclear to users and did not seem optional. Users often questioned, “Why do they need my SSN?”.
          <br><br>
          I embedded this verification as an option into the form creation process and created a link to the experian flow only if users wanted to add credit reports. By presenting this option only when it applies to the user’s task, users were able to understand the context of Experian verification.</p>
