    <!--Summary-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In 2019, with growing online demand in a B2B market, Shopify wanted to expand into the B2B market and build a fully native B2B platform integrated within the existing D2C platform. In 2022, Shopify <a href="https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2022#b2b">launched a B2B platform</a> where I lead design for the B2B Checkout team.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
    </div>

    <!--The Problem-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Shopify has originally been a B2C ecommerce platform. However with <strong>80% of B2B commerce moving online by 2025</strong> Shopify wanted to move into the B2B market. Moreover, the global B2B ecommerce market has been outpacing the B2C ecommerce market—five times over—with a<strong> $17.9 trillion valuation</strong>.
          <br><br>
          Shopify had proven the need for B2B eCommerce solutions through their first party app, the Plus Wholesale Channel. However, the app lacked key features and customization. Merchants were also using third party wholesale apps as a workaround but it still required a lot of manual work for merchants.
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="section-highlight-background">
          <p><strong>Manual and time-consuming B2B processes hindered the scalability and efficiency of wholesale businesses prompting the need for a streamlined solution.</strong></p>
        </div>

    <!--Goals-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>We needed to build the foundation for B2B to streamline the process for our merchants doing B2B commerce.
          <br></br>
          For the initial launch of the B2B platform, the key needs we planned to address are:
          <ul>
            <li>• Merchants can <strong>manage</strong> their companies/buyers in the admin</li>
            <li>• Merchants can <strong>customize</strong> product availability, pricing, payment terms, and payment methods for their companies</li>
            <li>• Buyers of companies can <strong>purchase</strong> the right products at the right prices</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
    </div>

    <!--The Process-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>My team, B2B Checkout, was in charge of the last bullet, which focused on the buyer experience. The team consisted of myself, my product manager, and engineering.
          <!--
          <br><br>
          B2B Checkout was ultimately the area where all B2B features converged. It was crucial that we collaborate closely with other B2B teams so that B2B business customers, pricing and deferred payments all showed up and functioned accurately in the final steps of a B2B transaction.-->

    <!--B2B Checkout Guiding principles-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h3>B2B Checkout Guiding principles</h3>
        <p>B2B buying is a very different experience from B2B. in B2C, the emphasis lies on discovery and checkout conversion, with a streamlined process and a focus on a few line items. In contrast, the B2B experience prioritizes efficiency and re-orders, involving a non-linear path with negotiations on payment terms. The B2B checkout is highly customer-specific, reflecting individually assigned terms and methods negotiated between buyers and merchants.

          <br><br>
          As I designed the checkout, I established UX principles to guide my design decisions:

          <!--

          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>• <strong>Reflect the real-world relationship between B2B merchants and buyers</strong> and allow for a seamless integration of online and offline interactions where end-to-end automation is not feasible.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>• <strong> Consistency is key</strong> to driving buyer and merchant trust in checkout. Any divergence from that path must be thoroughly evaluated and contextualized for the user.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>• <strong>Transparency, clarity and accuracy of information are essential</strong> to automating B2B purchasing through checkout. Acceleration and defaults must prove to be effective in the B2B context.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          -->
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--Accuracy is essential-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p><strong>Transparency, clarity and accuracy of information are essential</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>In B2C we optimize for conversion and visually streamline as much as possible. However in B2B, buyers deal in high-value purchases, so any misstep is magnified. Thus the it’s very important that the buyer has transparency of every piece of information.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <img src="images/B2B checkout/B2B-accuracy-image.png" alt="">
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--Reflecting real-world relationship-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <p><strong>Reflect the real-world relationship between B2B merchants and buyers</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>In B2B, there is an existing buying relationship between the merchant and buyer, and it's important that those aspects translate into Checkout.
        <br><br>
        For exmample, In B2C, it is often common for shipping and billing addresses to be the same. However in B2B, that is not typically the case. The address where the shipment location and the billing department can often be separate locations.

    <!--B2B Merchant needs-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h3>B2B Merchant needs</h3>
        <p>Based on the B2B merchant needs, the checkout needed to account for 3 main aspects:
          <br><br>
          <div class="section-highlight-background">
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Checkout must support merchant order review and editing step before order finalization.</strong>
                <br>
                Merchants need the flexibility to change an order or verify inventory, pricing and more before submitting the order for fulfillment.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Some customers must pay at checkout, while others are allowed to defer payment.</strong>
                <br>
                B2B is very relationship-based. Buyers negotiate specific payment terms and methods with the merchant, therefore the checkout needs to be customer specific and reflect assigned terms and methods.</li>
              <br>
              <li><strong>Every customer is known, and price and payment requirements vary by company.</strong>
                <br>
                Merchants have specifically defined pricing and payment settings for their customers, thus every buyer needs to be logged in order to checkout and see the correct pricing information.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <!--The Solution-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>From the B2B merchant needs, I designed 3 main types of checkout flows:
          <ul>
            <li>• <strong>Pay now checkout</strong></li>
            <li>• <strong>Pay later checkout</strong></li>
            <li>• <strong>Checkout to Draft</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="images/B2B checkout/B2B-main flows screenshot.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>

    </div>

    <!--Pay now checkout-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h3>Pay now checkout</h3>
        <p>When a merchant doesn’t have a well-established their buying relationship with the buyer, they can require immediate payment at checkout to reduce the risk of non-payment. This approach helps the merchant secure payment before fulfilling the order.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="images/B2B checkout/Pay now checkout flow.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
    </div>

    <!--Streamlining the buyer experience-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <p><strong>Streamlining the buyer experience</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon clicking checkout, the buyer is accelerated to the Payment page with their account information prefilled. This allows a more streamlined and efficient experience. Buyer then inputs payment information or selects a vaulted card if there any saved on the company account.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <img src="images/B2B checkout/Pay now flow.gif" class="dropshadow-radius">
        
      </div>
    </div>

  
    <!--Pay later checkout-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h3>Pay later checkout</h3>
        <p>In this case the buyer is assigned payment terms by merchant. The order is created and payment is deferred to the future. This is common in well-established and trusted buying relationships, providing flexibility to the buyer while relying on their creditworthiness for payment assurance.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="images/B2B checkout/Pay later checkout flow.png" alt="">
          <img src="images/B2B checkout/Pay later flow mobile screenshot.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>

    <!--Payment terms-->

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <p><strong>Payment terms</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>For deferred payment scenarios, buyers have the option to select a vaulted card, enter a new card, or Choose payment later. Selecting “Choose payment method later” lets buyers decide how they’ll pay at a future date - and gives them an opportunity to pay with a check, money order or some other off-Shopify payment method.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <img src="images/B2B checkout/Payment terms.gif" class="dropshadow-radius">
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--Checkout to draft-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-1 hidden sm"></div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <h3>Checkout to draft</h3>
        <p>In this case the buyer has been assigned to checkout to draft order by merchant. Checkout will collect expected payment method for later charge and submit as a draft order. With bulk orders, B2B merchants typically need to verify inventory and/or manufacturing availability before order confirmation. Merchants expect that edits can be made after orders are submitted by buyers without downstream financial consequences such as refunds, credits, or additional charges.
        </p>

          <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>
            <br>
            From the usability testing, we discovered that buyers had some questions around the terminology with draft orders, so we worked with content to improve the content around draft order checkouts.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>User interviews</strong>
            <br>
